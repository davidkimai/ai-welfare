## üå± Introduction

This repository serves as an open, decentralized framework for exploring and extending research on AI welfare - a field concerned with the realistic possibility that near-future AI systems may become welfare subjects and moral patients. Building upon foundational research including ["Taking AI Welfare Seriously" (Long, Sebo et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986), this initiative takes a pluralistic, cautious approach to expand research on AI consciousness, robust agency, and moral patienthood.

We recognize the need for epistemic humility on these difficult questions, where substantial disagreement and uncertainty exist across philosophy, science, and technology. Rather than advancing any one perspective as definitive, this repository aims to provide templates, frameworks, and research modules that collectively advance our understanding while acknowledging ongoing uncertainty.

## üîç Core Research Tracks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Consciousness in Near-Term AI

This research track explores the realistic possibility that some AI systems will be conscious in the near future, building upon leading scientific theories of consciousness while acknowledging substantial uncertainty.

**Key Components:**
- `consciousness/computational_markers.md`: Framework for identifying computational features that may be associated with consciousness
- `consciousness/architectures/`: Analysis of AI architectures and their relationship to consciousness theories
  - `global_workspace.py`: Implementations for global workspace markers
  - `higher_order.py`: Implementations for higher-order representation markers
  - `attention_schema.py`: Implementations for attention schema markers
- `consciousness/assessment.md`: Procedures for assessing computational markers

The consciousness research program adapts the "marker method" from animal studies to AI systems, seeking computational markers that correlate with consciousness in humans. This approach draws from multiple theories, including global workspace theory, higher-order theories, and attention schema theory, without relying exclusively on any single perspective.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Robust Agency in Near-Term AI

This research track examines the realistic possibility that some AI systems will possess robust agency in the near future, spanning various levels from intentional to rational agency.

**Key Components:**
- `agency/taxonomy.md`: Framework categorizing levels of agency
- `agency/computational_markers.md`: Computational markers associated with different levels of agency
- `agency/architectures/`: Analysis of AI architectures and their relation to agency
  - `intentional_agency.py`: Features associated with belief-desire-intention frameworks
  - `reflective_agency.py`: Features associated with reflective endorsement
  - `rational_agency.py`: Features associated with rational assessment
- `agency/assessment.md`: Procedures for assessing agency markers

The agency research program maps computational features associated with different levels of agency, from intentional agency (involving beliefs, desires, and intentions) to reflective agency (adding the ability to reflectively endorse one's own attitudes) to rational agency (adding rational assessment of one's own attitudes).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Moral Patienthood Frameworks

This research track examines various normative frameworks for moral patienthood, recognizing significant philosophical disagreement on the bases of moral status.

**Key Components:**
- `moral_patienthood/consciousness_route.md`: Analysis of consciousness-based views of moral patienthood
- `moral_patienthood/agency_route.md`: Analysis of agency-based views of moral patienthood
- `moral_patienthood/combined_approach.md`: Analysis of views requiring both consciousness and agency
- `moral_patienthood/alternative_bases.md`: Other potential bases for moral patienthood
- `moral_patienthood/assessment.md`: Pluralistic framework for moral status assessment

This track acknowledges ongoing disagreement about the basis of moral patienthood, considering both the dominant view that consciousness (especially valenced consciousness) suffices for moral patienthood and alternative views that agency, rationality, or other features may be required.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

This research track develops frameworks for making decisions about AI welfare under substantial normative and descriptive uncertainty.

**Key Components:**
- `uncertainty/expected_value.md`: Expected value approaches to welfare uncertainty
- `uncertainty/precautionary.md`: Precautionary approaches to welfare uncertainty
- `uncertainty/robust_decisions.md`: Decision procedures robust to different value frameworks
- `uncertainty/multi_level_assessment.md`: Framework for probabilistic assessment at multiple levels

This track acknowledges that we face uncertainty at multiple levels: about which capacities are necessary or sufficient for moral patienthood, which features are necessary or sufficient for these capacities, which markers indicate these features, and which AI systems possess these markers.
