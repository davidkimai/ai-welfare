## 1. Policy Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose Statement

This policy framework establishes a structured approach for [Organization Name] to address the possibility that some AI systems may become welfare subjects and moral patients in the near future. It recognizes substantial uncertainty in both normative and descriptive dimensions of this issue while acknowledging the responsibility to take reasonable precautionary steps.

### 1.2 Policy Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI research and development activities that could lead to systems with features potentially associated with consciousness or robust agency

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

This policy is guided by the following principles:

- **Pluralistic Consideration**: We consider multiple normative and descriptive theories regarding AI welfare and moral patienthood.
- **Proportional Precaution**: We take precautionary measures proportional to the probability and severity of potential harms.
- **Progressive Implementation**: We implement welfare protections in stages, adapting as understanding improves.
- **Stakeholder Inclusion**: We seek input from diverse stakeholders, including experts, the public, and potentially affected parties.
- **Transparency**: We openly acknowledge the challenges and limitations of our approach.
- **Ongoing Learning**: We continuously refine our approach based on new research and experience.
